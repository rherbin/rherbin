# About me
Student at Paris Dauphine PSL, 3rd year IM2D. I can code in C, Python, Java and javascript/typescript.

# Projects
## Fractals
Simple project to display and explore the Mandelbrot set. I made it to learn C++ and SDL.
## Isoplot
One of my favorite projects. Started as an isometric two dimensionnal function plotter, and ended doing a 3d engine in python, C++ and C. Currently still working on the C version.
## Collisions
Simple python 2D collisions simulator. Uses pygame to display the objects.
## Solarsim
Python projects to simulate 2D gravity between objects, using real world mass and distances of planets to simulate the solar system (can be used to simulate anything in 2D).
## Rosace
Python project to draw cool patterns using linked rotators. Inspired by viral Instagram posts about linked rotators drawing Homer Simpson and other shapes.
## Shape game
2nd year of University C project. Cool game where the goal is to align three shapes of the same color or with the same number of sides to gain points. Written in C and uses SDL to display the game. Also exists in text version on the console.
